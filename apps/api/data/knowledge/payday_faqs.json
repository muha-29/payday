                    "answer": "Saving even ₹10–₹20 daily builds a habit. Small savings protect you on days when income is low. You don’t need to save big amounts to start."

                    "answer": "A safe rule is 5–10% of what you earn today. If income is low, it’s okay to save less or skip. Saving should never cause stress."

                    "answer": "Irregular income means your earnings change daily or weekly. Many gig workers have this. Planning daily savings works better than monthly budgets."

                    "question": "Needs vs wants",
                    "answer": "Needs are essentials like food, rent, travel. Wants are optional like eating out or shopping. Saving becomes easier when needs are covered first."

                    "answer": "Adding income daily helps you see patterns. You understand which days are good and which are slow. This helps plan savings better."
